TODO:
-----
1. consider adding https://plantuml.com/mindmap-diagram (via plugin)
2. consider using same content count display for the generic categories as for a selected sub-category (currently it displays how many items are in the concrete cat., no details on the sub-cat item count)
3. consider importing additional features and styles from:
    - https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy
    - https://chirpy.cotes.page/
4. consider adding a default footer that can be turned on/off via page.data properties
