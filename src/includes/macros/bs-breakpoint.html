{#
    breakpoint values: false | true | sm | md | lg | xl | xxl | fluid

    if breakpoint is false (or null) - we use the noBreakClass as result;
    if breakpoint is true (or empty string), base class is to be expected;
    otherwise the result is: baseClass + "-" + breakpoint;

    NOTE:
    bootstrap requires a .container if we want to use .rows but containers have extra spaces (gutters around).
    
    to remove the extra space, BS docs suggest to use .g-0 and an .overflow-hidden container, which renders .position-sticky useless (non working).
    the overflow is vidible and causing side effects on small screens when we use width: 100%.
    other suggested "patches" are cumbersome to use.
    
    an alternative solution is to use .g-0 both on the main .container and the immediate .row's inside.
