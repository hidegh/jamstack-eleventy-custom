SimplyPut Consulting transformed this $5 Million biometric testing company into **$150 Million Covid Testing and Vaccination company** in two monthsâ€‹!

To manage the new workload, **the company changed its internal processes**. It required custom tools for its team leaders to enable them to administer dispatched staff at off-site testing locations more effectively.

**They needed a specific and focused view of the data** on their subordinates, including timecards, absenteeism, ratings and a way to manipulate these effectively. These data were from a **3rd party system** and originally synced <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shiftboard.com/">Shiftboard</a> via **Azure App Logic**.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation fa-fw pe-3 text-danger"></i> Initial problems

**The initial solution was developed for approx. 4 months was failing, the reasons:**

1. **Wrong hire** (non lead and non mature enough senior developers) resulted in **quality issues** in the developed product. Missing software related processes made it hard to track progress or to track deployed changes also lead to **faulty deployments** too (both on .NET and Angular side).

2. **Non-ideal tool selection for synchronization logic** - showed as a problem just later on, the functions in Azure Logic App were repetitive, hard to adjust, ignored some architectural characteristics of the platform (rate limiting), and the ineffective (non-batched) coding approach resulted in long synchronization times and sometimes even failing without a trace.



## <i class="fa-solid fa-shoe-prints fa-fw pe-3 text-secondary"></i> First steps we took

1. **Stabilized deployment** and traceability of work by introducing git-flow, creating CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps.

2. We **fixed architecture**, and introduced environment settings in the applications, and defined some routing rules for UI.

3. Started to **replace the UI screens step-by step**. This included changes inside the API (back-end) code.

<span class="fw-bold text-success">At the end of the 2nd month: the entire application was replaced with a new one (redesigned screens, stable functions)</span>

From this moment on we could focus on new enhancements and continuous improvements.



## <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb fa-fw pe-3 text-info"></i> New possibilities

Having **less support tickets** (bugs) enabled us to **focus** on getting the **sync process** right - we moved from Azure App Logic to a custom but generic .NET function, which we executed **periodically** via integrating Hangfire.IO to the back-end.

We were **able to react to new business requirements instantly** as time spent on upkeep was reduced considerably. This enabled us new projects and further possibilities.

## <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check fa-fw pe-3 text-success"></i> Final state

The project is **still in use**. It **requires minimal technical attention** and has worked **without intervention for over months** in a strike.
