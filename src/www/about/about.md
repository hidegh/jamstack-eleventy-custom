# About

We believe that **true change begins from within**, and it is only through our own motivation and dedication that we can put in the hard work required to move forward.

The name **'Reflection'** implies much about what IT, and companies overall, need to do to find success; it is not just a reference from .NET language, but also reflects the **importance of transformation**.

**Our mission:** is to make sure your software project is a success, and we have the experience and expertise to make it happen.

**We differ and that makes us succeed:** we follow simple guidelines and offer on-hand technical leadership to SMEs in the field of custom enterprise software development and team management.

**Our team has a proven track record of solving software and business problems**, and we help our clients define, manage, develop, and deploy high-quality software that meets their business needs.

1. **Rescue of Struggling Projects** and Identification of Bottlenecks and Risks, as well as Solutions to Business Problems
1. **Audits** and a **Second Opinion** in Software Related Matters
1. **Analysis, Design, and Development of Distributed Enterprise Solutions** with a Focus on Scalability, Extensibility, Maintainability, and Long-Term Low Costs
